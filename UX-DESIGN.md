### Pet Page
This is the daily **dashboard** for tracking nutrition and caring for the pet.  
Users can view today’s goals and status, and see their progress convert into the pet’s XP (healthier eating → more XP → a stronger pet).  
Navigation options lead to **Feed** (rewards) and **Records/History** (meal logs).
